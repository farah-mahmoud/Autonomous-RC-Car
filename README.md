# Project Overview
This project is centered around the development of an Autonomous RC Car
The project aims to harness cutting-edge technologies such as LiDAR, cameras, GPS, and IMU to create a fully autonomous navigation system. By integrating these advanced sensors with robust software algorithms for object detection, path planning, and real-time decision-making, the car will be capable of perceiving its environment, understanding complex road scenarios, and navigating safely.
The project involves several innovative features including SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), dynamic obstacle avoidance, and closed-loop control systems for precise maneuvering. Our team also employs simulation tools like Gazebo and RViz to develop and test algorithms in a virtual environment before real-world implementation. This ambitious project not only showcases the application of modern robotics and autonomous driving technology but also aims to contribute to the field by exploring new methodologies and enhancing existing ones.
